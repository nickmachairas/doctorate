Background
----------

The original version of DFLTD includes methods of search for foundations of specific site and pile characteristics from the more than 1,500 load test results available (:ref:`Kalavar and Ealy, 2000 <Kalavar2000>`). Although DFLTD claimed over 1,500 load tests, the author is not aware of any studies that have been able to employ a substantial portion of these tests in comparing interpreted and computing capacities because most tests lacked crucial information necessary for either interpreting the test, or computing the capacity. This is a problem with all piling databases. For example the Olson database classified tests into five data quality factors, for both soils information and pile load test information. Few tests in the entire Olson database achieved a top tier classification in both categories, and thus nearly all analyses were based on fewer than 100 high quality tests.

FHWA rekindled the effort to gather and distribute load test information on piles, as part of its effort to develop a method for predicting the axial capacity of large diameter open ended pipe piles. This effort resulted in the release of the Deep Foundation Load Test Database v.2 (DFLTD v.2) in February 2017 (:ref:`Petek et al., 2016 <Petek2016>`).
