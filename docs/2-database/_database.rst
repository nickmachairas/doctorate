Many of the methods in current use for pile design are based on small databases of interpreted load test data. For piles in sand, Nordlund (:ref:`1963 <Nordlund1963>`, :ref:`1979 <Nordlund1979>`) developed his method of calculating bearing capacity of piles in cohesionless soils from as few as 41 load tests from eight different test sites. Similarly, for clays, Tomlinson (:ref:`1957 <Tomlinson1957>`, :ref:`1971 <Tomlinson1971>`) employed a small data set of 56 piles to develop his popular Alpha-design method that was based in part on data published by Peck (:ref:`1958 <Peck1958>`). These methods were adopted by several design standards including, The Canadian Manual on Foundation Engineering (:ref:`1975 <Canadian1975>`), The American Petroleum Institute (:ref:`API RP 2A, 1989 <API1989>`), and FHWA (:ref:`Hannigan et al., 2016a <Hannigan2016a>`, :ref:`2016b <Hannigan2016b>`). Due to the dependence of soil behavior upon geography and site-specific circumstances and the use of limited data employed to launch historical foundation design methods, it is possible that many currently practiced methods of pile design, are based on empirical formulas that required gross overgeneralization to develop.

To address this concern, several past geotechnical studies have been undertaken with a focus on the expansion of load test databases in order to improve the methods employed to predict the axial capacity of piles. The first modern effort to organize a database of measured and interpreted pile capacities was performed at the behest of the American Petroleum Institute (API) by Professor Olson and his students at the University of Texas (:ref:`Dennis and Olson, 1983a <Dennis1983a>`, :ref:`1983b <Dennis1983b>`). This effort led to the development of the popular API RP-2A method for capacity of piles in sand (10). Later efforts were made to improve on both the size of the database and on its interpretation (:ref:`Olson and Al-Shafei, 1988 <Olson1988>`; :ref:`Olson, 1990 <Olson1990>`; :ref:`Iskander and Olson, 1992 <Iskander1992>`; :ref:`Olson and Iskander, 1994 <Olson1994>`; :ref:`Olson and Iskander, 1998 <Olson1998>`; :ref:`Olson and Shantz, 2004 <Olson2004>`; :ref:`Olson and Iskander, 2009 <Olson2009>`). Later FHWA began a parallel effort to develop a Deep Foundation Load Test Database (DFLTD) under the leadership of Carl Ealy (:ref:`Kalavar and Ealy, 2000 <Kalavar2000>`). Likewise, several highway departments developed state databases of interpreted pile capacities including Iowa, Illinois, and Louisiana (:ref:`Roling et al., 2010 <Roling2010>`; :ref:`Roling et al., 2011 <Roling2011>`; :ref:`Tavera et al., 2016 <Tavera2016>`; :ref:`Long and Anderson, 2012 <Long2012>`). Similarly several small databases have been developed at a number of universities and research centers including the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI), and at Texas A&M (:ref:`Briaud et al., 1987 <Briaud1987>`; :ref:`Lacasse, 1988 <Lacasse1988>`; :ref:`Paikowsky, 2001 <Paikowsky2001>`).

The original version of DFLTD includes methods of search for foundations of specific site and pile characteristics from the more than 1,500 load test results available (:ref:`Kalavar and Ealy, 2000 <Kalavar2000>`). Although DFLTD claimed over 1,500 load tests, the authors are not aware of any studies that have been able to employ a substantial portion of these tests in comparing interpreted and computing capacities because most tests lacked crucial information necessary for either interpreting the test, or computing the capacity. This is a problem with all piling databases. For example the Olson database classified tests into 5 data quality factors, for both soils information and pile load test information. Few tests in the entire Olson database achieved a top tier classification in both categories, and thus nearly all analyses were based on fewer than 100 high quality  tests.

In a 2013 memorandum, Abu-Hejleh describes the DFLTD as being "outdated" to the point of impossibility of database expansion (:ref:`Abu-Hejleh, 2013 <Abu-Hejleh2013>`). Abu-Hejleh et al. (:ref:`Abu-Hejleh et al., 2015a <Abu-Hejleh2015a>`) discussed the usefulness of current databases in use in the United States and establishes the suggested minimum data required for load test databases pertaining to Project Data, Subsurface Data at the Load Test Foundation, Test Foundation Data, Load Test Data, and attachment of useful files. The guidelines for developing useful load test databases discussed by Abu-Hejleh et al. were last updated in 2015 (:ref:`Abu-Hejleh et al., 2015b <Abu-Hejleh2015b>`).

FHWA rekindled the effort to gather and distribute load test information on piles, as part of its effort to develop a method for predicting the axial capacity of large diameter open ended pipe piles. This effort resulted in the release of the Deep Foundation Load Test Database v.2 (DFLTD v.2) in February 2017 (:ref:`Petek et al., 2016 <Petek2016>`).
