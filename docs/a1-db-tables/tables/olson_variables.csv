**DQF**,"Data quality factor. The DQF represents our qualitative view of the overall quality of the data. (5)	indicates outstanding data. Generally we knew the author. There were soil borings very close to the pile and numerous soil tests were performed. The SQF was high. The soil profile was uniform enough that we thought the soil conditions at the load test point were well known. There was a reasonable set-up time for the pile. The pile was often instrumented. (1) indicates major uncertainties. For example, the soil profile may vary widely from place to place on a site and there is no boring right next to the pile. In other cases the only measure of clay strength is an N value. In some cases the measured soil properties scattered greatly with respect to depth. In some cases the driving record did not compare with the soil profile, e.g., a sudden increase in driving resistance at the end when there was no evidence of a stronger layer at that depth.",``projects.dqf``
**SetUpTm**,Set up time (days),``load_tests.setup_time``
**Ref**,"The reference number (reference to a paper, report, etc.) from the reference list in a separate file",``projects.source_ref``
