      This research endeavor encompasses the following objectives, as reiterated in
      the March 5, 2019 Memorandum between the author and the PhD Guidance Committee.

      1. Evaluation of available methods for estimating the **interpreted capacity**
         of single driven piles from static load tests and address the research
         question as to which is the best method, especially for LDOEPs.
      2. Evaluation of various available methods for calculating the **nominal
         resistance** of single driven piles against the pile load tests stored in the
         Warehouse; and selection of the best performing design method as the basis
         to propose an improved design method. In particular, you should address the
         research question of whether or not existing interpreted capacity methods
         from static load tests for piles wider than 36 inches are suitable for
         LDOEPs.
      3. Address the long-standing research question of whether or not, and under
         what conditions does skin friction increase linearly with depth, using data
         in the Warehouse.
      4. Employ the warehouse to provide recommendations for revised resistance
         factors for design.
      5. Address the research question of whether or not soil plugging is affected by
         factors other than pileâ€™s length to diameter ratio.
