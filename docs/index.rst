Prediction of the Ultimate Capacity of Driven Piles and Optimization of Design Parameters
=========================================================================================


This research endeavor encompasses the following objectives, as reiterated in
the March 5, 2019 Memorandum between the author and the PhD Guidance Committee.

1. Evaluation of available methods for estimating the **interpreted capacity**
   of single driven piles from static load tests and address the research
   question as to which is the best method, especially for LDOEPs.
2. Evaluation of various available methods for calculating the **nominal
   resistance** of single driven piles against the pile load tests stored in the
   Warehouse; and selection of the best performing design method as the basis
   to propose an improved design method. In particular, you should address the
   research question of whether or not existing interpreted capacity methods
   from static load tests for piles wider than 36 inches are suitable for
   LDOEPs.
3. Address the long-standing research question of whether or not, and under
   what conditions does skin friction increase linearly with depth, using data
   in the Warehouse.
4. Employ the warehouse to provide recommendations for revised resistance
   factors for design.
5. Address the research question of whether or not soil plugging is affected by
   factors other than pile’s length to diameter ratio.
