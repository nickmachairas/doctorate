  This research endeavor encompasses the following objectives, as reiterated in
  the March 5, 2019 Memorandum between the author and the PhD Guidance Committee.

  1. Evaluation of available methods for estimating the **interpreted capacity**
     of single driven piles from static load tests and address the research
     question as to which is the best method, especially for LDOEPs.
  2. Evaluation of various available methods for calculating the **nominal
     resistance** of single driven piles against the pile load tests stored in the
     Warehouse; and selection of the best performing design method as the basis
     to propose an improved design method. In particular, you should address the
     research question of whether or not existing interpreted capacity methods
     from static load tests for piles wider than 36 inches are suitable for
     LDOEPs.
  3. Address the long-standing research question of whether or not, and under
     what conditions does skin friction increase linearly with depth, using data
     in the Warehouse.
  4. Employ the warehouse to provide recommendations for revised resistance
     factors for design.
  5. Address the research question of whether or not soil plugging is affected by
     factors other than pileâ€™s length to diameter ratio.
